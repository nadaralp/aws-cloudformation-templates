1. Check if nested stacks get psuedo parameters - Psuedo parameters are passed. But the AWS::StackName changes for the child template since it has a different stack name.
I solved it by passing the ParentStackName to the template

2. Check if nested stack can resolve parameters dynamically.
You can. When you resolve a secret it doesn't show the plain value never.
But the resources created will have the value stored in the secret.

For example: The Physical ID will be {{resolve:secretsmanager:github_secrets:SecretString:testkey}}
But internally it will create the required bucket


3. Does deleting parent stack deletes all child?
Yes


4. Create RDS with VPC cloudformation templates
